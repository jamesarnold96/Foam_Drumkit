# Foam_Drumkit
Low-cost Arduino MIDI drum kit using packing foam or similar materials. This repository contains the Arduino code, a perfboard diagram, a schematic, and the Fritzing file used to produce the diagrams. Any Arduino can be used for this project, although a Nano is recommended due to that model being used in the schematics. 

Note: This code requires the arduino_midi_libary to function (available at https://github.com/FortySevenEffects/arduino_midi_library/)
